Welcome to the MARY TTS (text-to-speech) installer.

MARY is a program that can convert written text into audible speech.
It is written in Java and will work under Microsoft Windows, Linux,
Solaris and MacOSX.

This integrated installer will install the MARY TTS system on your computer.
As MARY is a very modular system (MARY stands for "Modular Architecture for
Research on speech sYnthesis), you can select the MARY components that you
wish to install. Different components are distributed under various licenses.
You will have to accept the licenses for the selected components before the
installer will download these components from the internet and install them.

IMPORTANT: Do spend some time selecting the right components, to get
the optimal system for your needs! You have the choice between
different languages, voices, or enhancement packs that improve synthesis,
but which are distributed under a more restricted license than the basic
OpenMary system.
