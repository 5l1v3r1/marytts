/**
 * Prosody transformation algorithms for voice conversion.
 * A prosody modification framework has been implemented which supports:
 *  -Mean and standard deviation transformation of f0
 *  -Sentence slope transformation
 * <p>
 * Mean and standard deviation transformation is the best method so far.
 * Duration and energy transformation have not yet been implemented.
