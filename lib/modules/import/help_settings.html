SETTINGS HELP

Warning: the settings of the modules are connected: If you change a setting in one module, 
then maybe the next module will not work anymore! 

The settings are set up so that everything works, so normally you will not want to change anything.
Settings that you might want to change and that do not interact with other settings, are marked with a star (*).
